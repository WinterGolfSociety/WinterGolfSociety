Local rules update#Friday 16th September 2022#from 16th September 2022 Committee meeting minutes.


iii) There are still debates about local rules at Longhirst Golf Club and the fact that, if they are not written down they do not exist. It is intended to approach Graham Chambers to clarify the position about local rules and have a signed copy of these rules produced to clear up any ambiguities. (GG)
