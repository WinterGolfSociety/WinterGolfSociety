After ordering and quoting 2 sets of numbers. I put my phone away, fastened my coat, picked up my shopping and waited for my item. 
When it came I was asked for one of the codes from less than a minute ago. I had to put down my shopping, unfasten my coat, get out my pjone, open hhe email and find the code before I could have what I'd purchased, then put my phone away, fasten my coat, pick up my shopping etc.
