Since there is no longer a Friday "mix-up" I propose running a Winter Golf Society so that anyone who wishes, has the opportunity to play a social round of golf over the winter period. <br><br>These rounds are meant to be informal, enjoyable and inclusive of those players who would otherwise be excluded by virtue of buggy use on paths only etc .. It will be run by me and take place on a Friday.       
<br><br>
It will run in a similar format I have played over the past couple of winters, as this seemed to work well.

 <br><br>
        <br>- groups are always encouraged to make a conscious effort to keep pace with the group ahead.<br>
        <br>- preferred lies in the "general area".<br>
        <br>- tees and mats can be used in the "general area" as close as is practical to where the ball lies, but not nearer the hole.<br>
        <br>- free relief from any standing water (or ice/snow ?), as close as is practical to where the ball lies but not nearer hole.<br>
        <br>- drivers not to be used after the initial tee shot.<br>
        <br>- bunkers not in play. Relief to be taken within one club length behind the bunker in an extended  direct line between the flag and where the ball was lying in the bunker.<br>
        <br>- where necessary, assist players by moving the ball to be next to paths etc.<br>
