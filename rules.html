Since there is no longer a Friday "mix-up" The intention is to run a Winter Golf Society so that anyone who wishes, has the opportunity to play a social round of golf over the winter period. <br><br>These rounds are meant to be informal, enjoyable and inclusive of those players who would otherwise be excluded by virtue of buggy use on paths only etc .. It will be run as a Society and take place on a Friday.       
<br><br>
It will run in a similar format I have played over the past couple of winters, as this seemed to work well.
<br><br>
Calendar is shown below.

 <p id="subtxt"><img src="rulesbw.gif" alt="G" width="200" height="200" id="image1" ><br><br><br>my .. Winter Golf Society rules</p>
 <br><br>
	<br>- most rules are to be be applied fairly and with a sense of proportion where possible.</br>
        <br>- groups are always encouraged to make a conscious effort to keep pace with the group ahead.<br>
        <br>- preferred lies on grass cut to fairway length and from 1st/2nd cut, but not from any extreme rough. The preferred lie should be as close as is practical to the balls original position, but not nearer the hole<br>
        <br>- tees and mats can be used when preferring a lie.<br>
        <br>- free relief from any standing water (or ice/snow ?), as close as is practical to where the ball lies but not nearer hole.<br>
        <br>- drivers not to be used after the initial tee shot.<br>
        <br>- bunkers not in play. Relief to be taken within one club length behind the bunker in an extended  direct line between the flag and where the ball was lying in the bunker.<br>
        <br>- because buggies must remain on the paths at all times, where necessary, assist players by moving the ball to be next to paths etc.<br>
	<br>
	 <p id="subtxt"><img src="pound.png" alt="G" width="200" height="200" id="image1" ><br><br><br>Prize money</p>
 <br><br>
	
	<p> - The entry fee is £2, £1 for stableford competition, £1 twos.</p>
	<p> - No money will be held over and there will be as near as possible 100% payout each week.</p> 
	<p>Prize money for stableford competition</p> 
	<p> - The competition format is stableford but with a 100% adjustment, hence Playing Handicap = Course Handicap.</p>
	<p> - 20 or more entries, money split 50% 30% 20% for 1st, 2nd and 3rd places.</p>
	<p> - Less than 20 entries money split 60% 40% for 1st and 2nd places.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Prize money for twos.</p>
	<p> - Divide total twos money amongst each two scored.</p>
	<p> - If no twos, money is added to the stableford prize money.</p>
	<p> - Any prize money will be rounded to the nearest 50p</p> 
	<p> - Countback is the normal, stableford points on last 9, 6, 3, 1. Then, rarely, the best scores across the most difficult hole, then three, then six, then nine.</p>
	<p> - you are entirely responsible for submiting your own scores and for the accuracy of the scores and Course/Playing handicap submitted.</p
	<p> - if no score is submitted by 4pm it will not be counted.</p
