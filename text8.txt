Apologies: Tony Smith

The minutes of the previous meeting were read and agreed.

Matters Arising.
1. The new whiteboard has been purchased to reflect any rule changes for that day. It was agreed this needs to be displayed at sign on so all players are aware of any changes due to inclement weather or any local changes passed over from club staff. (All)
2. The Christmas Lunch was a great success and it appears the format for the day was extremely successful. It was agreed this format would be adopted in future years. The Raffle was extremely successful and made Â£200 for the Seniors Section.
3. Thanks to Bryan Craggs, we have photos from the presentation of Trophies. It was agreed next year there should be a more formal photograph shoot and a group photo of all winners taken in addition to individual photos.

2023 Fixtures:
The 2023 fixtures schedule has been finalised and agreed. This year sees 2 more friendly matches home and away to Blyth and South Shields Golf Clubs. The full schedule will be printed and put on the notice board. Personal copies will be issued when Seniors Memberships are renewed. Enquiries are still in progress to find a suitable venue for next seasons away days (G.G)
